"* Write title* ----------> Humans are highly social individuals who like to share life and experiences with family and friends.      The strong development and impact of various social networking tools illustrate the fundamental human desire for social belonging and interpersonal exchange.       In addition, there is emerging evidence that evolutionary processes have favored the development of complex social behaviors in humans, along with the brain architecture that supports them.       The human brain, and particularly the neocortex, is larger in humans as compared to other primates and mammals of similar size.       The neocortex includes several of the brain areas involved in higher social cognition, language, behavioral and emotion regulation, as well as empathy and the ability to understand the feelings and intentions of others.       We are biologically hard-wired for interacting with others, and endowed with a “social brain.      ” Compared to other mammals, human children have a very long developmental period and are highly dependent on care by adults.       Human parents not only have to nurture their children until their brains are fully operational biologically, but they also have to provide an extended and stable context within which their children can safely acquire all the skills necessary for understanding their social surroundings, a process that continues far beyond childhood.       For example, some social skills can only be learned by means of peer activities during adolescence, and throughout this period parents still have important protective and sheltering roles3.       In addition, interesting studies show greater BOLD responses (proxy for brain activity) in the striatum when sharing the positive outcomes with a close friend in the network set up as compared to when sharing the reward with a confederate (out of network) or a non social entity as a computer4, highlighting the involvement of the striatum on the social functions.      Also rodents undergo an extensive period of reshaping of their behavioral phenotype from the birth until young adulthood [REF].     According to the theory of ~functional adaptation~, behavioral plasticity is maximal during the development, to help the growing organism to adapt to face the environment that he will face in adulthood.    reduce their effectiveness.            To increase fitness a high degree of behavioral plasticity must be retained (and achieved).
